Of course! That's a great dataset for this task. Since it's a  **classification dataset** , the structure is different from what our captioning script expects. We need to perform a preparation step to convert it into the right format.

I'll guide you through this process in detail. The main idea is to create a script that automatically generates the `metadata.jsonl` file from the dataset's folder structure.

---

### Step 1: Download and Organize the Dataset

First, download and unzip the dataset from Kaggle. Inside, you'll find `train`, `test`, and `valid` folders. We will focus on the `train` folder for fine-tuning.

Your project folder should look like this:

```
/my_car_project/
â”œâ”€â”€ Car Brand Classification/  <-- The unzipped folder from Kaggle
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Audi/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ BMW/
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1.jpg
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (many other brand folders)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ valid/
â””â”€â”€ ... (your scripts will go here)
```

---

### Step 2: Create the Dataset Preparation Script

This is the most important new step. We will create a Python script called `prepare_dataset.py`. This script's only job is to scan the `Car Brand Classification/train/` directory and create our `metadata.jsonl` file.

Create a new file named `prepare_dataset.py` in your `/my_car_project/` directory and paste the following code into it:

**`prepare_dataset.py`**

**Python**

```
import os
import json

def create_metadata_file():
    """
    Scans the classification dataset directory and creates a metadata.jsonl file
    for image captioning fine-tuning.
    """
    dataset_base_path = 'Car Brand Classification/train'
    output_file = 'metadata.jsonl'
  
    # Check if the dataset path exists
    if not os.path.exists(dataset_base_path):
        print(f"Error: Dataset path not found at '{dataset_base_path}'")
        print("Please make sure you have unzipped the Kaggle dataset correctly.")
        return

    print(f"Starting dataset preparation from: {dataset_base_path}")
  
    # We will write each entry to our output file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        # Get a list of all brand folders (e.g., 'Audi', 'BMW')
        brand_folders = [d for d in os.listdir(dataset_base_path) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(dataset_base_path, d))]
      
        total_images = 0
      
        # Loop through each brand folder
        for brand_name in brand_folders:
            print(f"  Processing brand: {brand_name}")
            brand_path = os.path.join(dataset_base_path, brand_name)
          
            # Get all image files in the brand folder
            image_files = [img for img in os.listdir(brand_path) if img.lower().endswith(('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'))]
          
            # For each image, create a caption and write it to our file
            for image_name in image_files:
                image_path = os.path.join(brand_path, image_name)
              
                # Create a descriptive caption. You can customize this!
                caption = f"A photo of a car from the brand {brand_name}."
              
                # Create the JSON object for this entry
                data_entry = {
                    "file_name": image_path,
                    "text": caption
                }
              
                # Write the JSON object as a line in the file
                f.write(json.dumps(data_entry) + '\n')
                total_images += 1

    print("-" * 30)
    print(f"Preparation complete!")
    print(f"Created '{output_file}' with {total_images} entries.")

# Run the function when the script is executed
if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_metadata_file()
```

### Step 3: The Updated Fine-Tuning Script

Now, here is the fine-tuning script, which we can call `finetune_cars.py`. It's the same as before, but it's designed to be used *after* you've run the preparation script.

Create a new file named `finetune_cars.py` in `/my_car_project/` and paste this code:

**`finetune_cars.py`**

**Python**

```
import torch
from PIL import Image
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from transformers import BlipProcessor, BlipForConditionalGeneration, TrainingArguments, Trainer
import pandas as pd
import os

# --- 1. Custom PyTorch Dataset (Reads from our generated metadata.jsonl) ---
class CarCaptionDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, jsonl_path, processor):
        # Check if metadata file exists
        if not os.path.exists(jsonl_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"Metadata file not found at '{jsonl_path}'. Please run prepare_dataset.py first.")
      
        self.data = pd.read_json(path_or_buf=jsonl_path, lines=True)
        self.processor = processor

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        item = self.data.iloc[idx]
        image_path = item['file_name']
        caption = item['text']
      
        try:
            image = Image.open(image_path).convert("RGB")
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print(f"Warning: Image not found at {image_path}. Skipping.")
            # Return None or handle this case as appropriate
            return None

        encoding = self.processor(images=image, text=caption, padding="max_length", return_tensors="pt")
        encoding = {k: v.squeeze() for k, v in encoding.items()}
        return encoding

# Custom collate function to filter out None values from the dataset
def collate_fn(batch):
    batch = [item for item in batch if item is not None]
    if not batch:
        return None
    return torch.utils.data.dataloader.default_collate(batch)

# --- 2. Load the Model and Processor ---
processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")
model = BlipForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base")

# --- 3. Prepare the Dataset and Trainer ---
train_dataset = CarCaptionDataset(jsonl_path='metadata.jsonl', processor=processor)

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./car_brand_model",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    num_train_epochs=1, # Start with 1 epoch as the dataset is large
    per_device_train_batch_size=8, # Adjust based on your GPU memory
    save_total_limit=2,
    save_steps=1000,
    logging_steps=100,
    push_to_hub=False, # Set to True if you want to upload to Hugging Face Hub
    remove_unused_columns=False, # Important for our custom dataset
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    data_collator=collate_fn, # Use the custom collate function
)

# --- 4. Start Fine-Tuning! ---
trainer.train()

# --- 5. Save the final model ---
trainer.save_model("./car_brand_model_final")
print("Fine-tuning complete and model saved!")
```

### Step 4: Your Complete Workflow ðŸš—

Here is the full workflow from start to finish:

1. **Setup:**
   * Create your project folder `/my_car_project/`.
   * Download and unzip the Kaggle dataset into it.
   * Create the two Python files: `prepare_dataset.py` and `finetune_cars.py`.
   * Make sure you are in your `huggingface` conda environment and have installed the necessary libraries: `pip install torch torchvision transformers Pillow pandas`.
2. **Run Data Preparation:**
   * Open your terminal in the `/my_car_project/` directory.
   * Run the preparation script  **once** :
     **Bash**

     ```
     python prepare_dataset.py
     ```
   * This will create the `metadata.jsonl` file, which contains thousands of lines, one for each training image.
3. **Run Fine-Tuning:**
   * Now, run the main training script:
     **Bash**

     ```
     python finetune_cars.py
     ```
   * This will start the fine-tuning process. It will take a long time and  **requires a GPU** . It will print progress logs and save the final model in a new folder called `car_brand_model_final`.

You have now successfully adapted a classification task into a captioning task for fine-tuning!
